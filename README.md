# ovsd
Open vSwitch configuration daemon to use with LEDE's netifd.

ovsd is being developed as part of Google Summer of Code 2016. It is currently subject to a lot of changes and still unstable. Once finished, it will be published here.

In the meantime, you can read about its progress and that of the netifd interface that I'm writing for it, in my [blog](http://blog.freifunk.net/arne-kappen).
